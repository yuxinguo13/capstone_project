          <p>
            In this study, we want to introduce a novel approach to sentiment analysis
            by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically Graph Attention
            Networks (GAT), with traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) tech-
            niques.
          </p>
          <p>
            By focusing on the challenges of interpreting long-range dependen-
            cies within text, particularly in the context of social media interactions, we
            propose a model that leverages the relational and textual information present
            in data from college SubReddit forums before and during the COVID-19 pan-
            demic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our methodology employs RoBERTa for text em-
            bedding, followed by a GAT to incorporate the structural relationships be-
            tween messages, enhancing the sentiment analysis capability beyond the lim-
            itations of conventional models.
          </p>

          <p>
            The results demonstrate a statistically signif-
            icant improvement in identifying and relating sentiments across distant text
            parts, underscoring the potential of GNNs in capturing complex interactions
            within text data. This research contributes to the evolving field of sentiment
            analysis by showcasing the effectiveness of combining GNNs with existing
            NLP frameworks, offering insights into the nuanced emotional landscape of
            digital communications during a global crisis.

          <p>
            In the dynamic realm of NLP, sentiment analysis stands as a cornerstone for unraveling the intricate emotional fabric of text. However, the traditional models often falter at the complex dance of sentiments in social media's vast expanse. This study introduces a novel confluence of Graph Neural Networks, particularly Graph Attention Networks, with the rich linguistic insights of NLP techniques such as RoBERTa. Centered on the vibrant dialogues within college SubReddit forums amid the COVID-19 period, our method transcends conventional sentiment analysis. It merges NLP's semantic depth with GNN's contextual acumen, aiming to illuminate the nuanced emotional landscape of digital discourse in these unprecedented times.

        <h2 class="title is-3">Dataset</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>The study analyzes social media data sourced from Reddit, focusing specifically on SubReddits associated with different colleges. This dataset covers two distinct time periods: 2019, representing the pre-pandemic landscape, and 2020, reflecting sentiments amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            <p>Selection criteria for the colleges included in the study were based on a variety of factors, such as geographic location, size, and their approach to in-person learning during the pandemic. This ensured a diverse representation of college communities.</p>
            <p>The dataset consists of 165,570 messages, including original posts, comments, and their respective replies. To enhance the reliability of the dataset, a significant subset of the data underwent manual labeling across various sentiment categories. This manual labeling process ensured a balanced and accurately labeled dataset for training and testing machine learning models.</p>

          <p>The study proposes a machine learning model to analyze sentiment in social media data. This model builds upon existing methodologies in sentiment analysis and natural language processing. Specifically, it leverages techniques such as sentiment lexicons, neural networks, and deep learning architectures.</p>
          <p>By integrating these advanced techniques, the model aims to accurately classify the sentiment expressed in social media messages, including posts, comments, and replies. The model undergoes rigorous testing and validation to ensure its effectiveness in capturing the nuanced sentiment variations present in the dataset.</p>
